      <h2>1. Understand Your Loan Terms</h2>
      <p>Before taking a loan, understand the interest rate, tenure, and EMI structure. This helps in planning your finances better.</p>

      <h2>2. Pay More Than the Minimum EMI</h2>
      <p>If possible, pay extra towards your loan. This reduces the principal amount and saves you money on interest.</p>

      <h2>3. Refinance for Better Interest Rates</h2>
      <p>Keep an eye out for lower interest rates and consider refinancing your loan if it reduces your financial burden.</p>

      <h2>4. Automate EMI Payments</h2>
      <p>Set up automatic payments to avoid missing EMIs and incurring penalties.</p>

      <h2>5. Maintain a Good Credit Score</h2>
      <p>A good credit score helps you get better loan offers and lower interest rates. Pay your bills on time to maintain a healthy credit profile.</p>
